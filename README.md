# Spam Detection AI Streamlit Application

This is a **Spam Detection AI** application built with Streamlit, designed to detect spam messages in text input and `.txt` files. The application uses a machine learning model to classify messages as either spam or not spam.

## Features

- **Text Input:** Users can input a text message, and the model will classify it as spam or not spam.
- **File Upload:** Users can upload `.txt` files, and the model will detect whether the contents are spam or not.
- **Real-time Classification:** The application processes input instantly and displays the results in real time.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- pickle (if model is serialized)

### Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detection-streamlit.git
cd spam-detection-streamlit
```

2. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.

4. Use the following features in the application:
- Text Input Box: Type or paste a message to be analyzed.
- Upload Button: Upload a .txt file to classify its contents.

## How It Works

The spam detection model is trained using a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam messages. The model uses text processing techniques such as tokenization, vectorization, and machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) to classify the text.

## Example Usage

### Text Input Example
- Input: "Congratulations, you've won a free gift card!"
- Output: Spam

### File Upload Example
- Upload a .txt file with a message like: "This is an urgent message to claim your reward!"
- Output: Spam
