# ðŸ“¥ Spam Detection AI Streamlit Application (NLP Based)

**Prepared by**: Shin Thant Phyo  
**Date**: 9th January 2025

## Project Overview

This project is a **Spam Detection AI** application built with **Streamlit**. It is designed to classify text messages as either **spam** or **not spam (ham)**. The system leverages machine learning models to predict the category of the input message, using algorithms such as **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

The web application allows users to:
- Input messages directly to be classified.
- Upload `.txt` files to analyze their content.
- View real-time classification results, including spam prediction with a clear, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Users can enter a text message, and the system will classify it as spam or ham.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload `.txt` files, and the application will classify the message inside the file as spam or ham.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: The application processes the input in real-time and displays the result instantly.

## How It Works

The system uses the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** to train a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. The machine learning pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Text Preprocessing**: 
    - Tokenization: Breaking down the message into individual words.
    - Vectorization: Converting text into numerical form using `TfidfVectorizer`.

2. **Model Training**: 
    - The model is trained using algorithms like **Random Forest**,**Logistic Regression** or **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

3. **Prediction**: 
    - Once trained, the model can classify unseen messages as spam or ham.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges:
- **Handling Imbalanced Datasets**: Spam messages typically outnumber non-spam messages, leading to potential bias in classification.
- **Model Selection**: Choosing the right model that ensures both high recall (minimizing false negatives) and precision (minimizing false positives).

### Solutions:
- **Oversampling**: Applied techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.
- **Model Comparison**: Experimented with multiple models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) to find the optimal balance of accuracy, speed, and precision.

## Future Improvements:
- **Enhanced Models**: Integrate advanced models, such as transformers, for better performance on complex datasets.
- **Multilingual Support**: Extend the system to handle multiple languages, expanding its use beyond English.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Add support for dynamic light/dark modes to improve the user experience.

## AI Ethics

### Ethical Considerations:
As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as spam detection systems become more prevalent, it is essential to address ethical concerns to ensure the responsible and fair application of AI. Some of the key ethical issues in spam detection are:

- **Bias and Fairness**: AI models can inherit biases present in the data they are trained on. This project has taken steps to address imbalances in the dataset by using oversampling techniques, but further work can be done to ensure fairness in classification across different types of messages.
  
- **Privacy and Data Security**: Spam detection systems analyze potentially sensitive text data. It is crucial to implement robust data privacy and security measures to protect users' information.

- **Transparency and Accountability**: Users should be able to understand how AI systems classify messages as spam or not. This project aims to provide clarity on model behavior through detailed results and explanations.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**: Spam tactics evolve over time, and AI models should be continuously updated to adapt to new patterns. The future improvement of this project includes regular updates to the model to handle evolving spam tactics.
